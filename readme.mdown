# Readme #
This repo is a script to sync data from a Google Drive spreadsheet to [Stitch](https://www.stitchdata.com).

**PLEASE NOTE:**  
This script is not supported by Stitch as an integration. Please feel free to contribute to this repository.

## Requirements ##
This connector assumes you have headers in in the spreadsheet in row 1 of the spreadsheet.  
This connector __will not work__ if you define more than 8 columns as keys.
The tab name __must__ only include alpha-numeric characters. Remove spaces, or replace with underscores.
You should make sure to set the columns to the correct data formats. For example, if a column contains all integers, please make sure it is not formatted as plain text.

## Installation & Set-up ##

1. Open the spreadsheet you would like to sync to Stitch.
2. Click Tools, Script Editor. Click Close on the Popup, or choose blank project.
3. Delete the contents of the file currently open
4. Copy the contents from this folders's [sheetstostitch.gs](sheetstostitch.gs) page, and paste into the 'code.gs' script file you have open.
5. Go back to the spreadsheet and refresh the page. If you don't see a new dropdown in the toolbar titled "Stitch Import", close the spreadsheet and re-open it.
6. In the "Stitch Import" dropdown, click "Set Stitch API credentials". You'll need to authorize the script to access the data, so log in with the Google account that has access to this sheet.
7. Enter API key and Client ID provided in your Stitch account.
8. In the "Stitch Import" dropdown, click "Set this sheet's primary key".
9. Choose which columns act as the unique key for your table. These columns must be unique for all current and future rows of this table. If you have multiple columns that make up the unique key, it's recommended that you hash them together using the [md5 Google Sheets function](md5_sheets.gs).

    ### More on using the md5 function
    To use this handy function in Google Sheets, enter the contents of the [md5_sheets.gs file](md5_sheets.gs) into Tools --> Script Editor. Then, to create a unique key in your sheet based on multiple columns, create an 'ID' column and in its cells enter " =md5(cell1&cell2&cellN) " where cells 1,2...N are the cells that make up your unique key. Make sure to format numbers or dates as text before using them in an md5 function to ensure the data being used to generate your unique key are in a specified format. If you plan to join this table to other data models based on this key, make sure the output matches what your warehouse generates from "select md5('cell1 contents' || 'cell2 contents' || 'cellN contents')". For more information on the function and its uses, check [here](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/the-most-underutilized-function-in-sql-9279b536ed1a) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5).


## Syncing another tab ##

If you store data in another tab that you would like to also sync to the Stitch Import API, you'll need to set up the keys in that sheet as well. You can do so by clicking on that tab, and following the directions below.  
1. In the "Stitch Import" dropdown, click "Set this sheet's primary key".  
2. Choose the keys(s) in this tab that make each row unique. Enter the relevant column headers exactly as you have them in the sheet. If more than one, it's recommended that you hash them together using the [md5 Google Sheets function](md5_sheets.gs).

## Syncing Data ##

1. Once you are ready to sync data to Stitch, select the sheet/tab you want to sync.
2. In the "Stitch Import" dropdown, click "Sync this sheet to Stitch".
3. Once data has replicated to your warehouse, query it to make sure it looks right and has all of the rows you need.
